## 🚀 About Me: My Life On & Off the Field

I'm a CS student who sees life as the ultimate team sport. I love building useful code, but I also thrive on the amateur football pitch. When I'm not with a team, I'm pushing my solo game as a triathlon athlete, exploring new trails as a hike geek, or holding down the rhythm (loudly and badly) as a bass player. My most important teams, however, are the ones that call me son, brother, grandson, friend, cousin, and boyfriend. My goal is to be an MVP for all of them.

## 💻 The Creative Technologist: My Toolkit

I'm a Computer Science student at Constructor University, but my tech stack is basically a time-travel paradox. On one hand, I'm an IBM Z Student Ambassador, which is a polite way of saying I voluntarily hang out with mainframes. Yes, I have willingly written COBOL , wrestled with z/OS , and mentored people on tech that's older than I am —and I even got invited to the IBM mothership in Böblingen to talk about it. But on the other hand, my "proficient in" list includes Rust, Kotlin, Python, and C++, so I'm not just a tech historian. I guess I'm "full-stack" if the stack spans 60 years. My summer internship wasn't fetching coffee; they had me at Living Mainframe actually building a "critical enterprise tool" with Flask, Python, C, and SQL to fix real client problems. When I'm not coding for the past or the future, I'm being "that guy" whose home lab is his playground. And it's not just a simple NAS anymore—my project is now best described (in the most gloriously over-the-top way possible) as "a study in Distributed, Software-Defined Homelab Architecture." I'm moving from a single, overwhelmed machine to a full multi-tiered system: a "Storage Layer" (an OMV laptop) for file serving, a "Compute Layer" (a desktop with Proxmox) to run my C/Rust projects in isolation so they can't break my data, and a "Utility Layer" (a Raspberry Pi) for things like Pi-hole and 3-2-1 backups. It's basically a hands-on, decentralized private cloud... which is a really fancy way of saying I'm still just trying to avoid paying for commercial cloud storage. Or I'm at a BMW hackathon just casually observing causal machine learning. I've also collected four Erasmus projects and speak four languages , so I can probably explain in English, German, Italian, or Romanian exactly why your code just failed.

## 🚀 On The Workbench

Right now, I'm juggling a few big things, both in my personal lab and in my career:

* **Project: The "Homelab Mission Control"**
    This is my main passion project. I'm building a custom console in **C/Rust** that will run as a lightweight container on my **Proxmox Compute Layer**. The goal is for it to be the "central nervous system" for my entire "Software-Defined Homelab."
    * It's being designed to securely mount shares from my **OMV Storage Layer** to access data.
    * **Features I'm exploring:**
        1.  A Terminal UI (TUI) dashboard to show real-time stats (Proxmox CPU, OMV disk usage, Pi-hole queries).
        2.  Custom CLI commands to automate my 3-2-1 backup strategy.
        3.  A "project" command that auto-provisions a new, isolated container for a new idea.

* **Academics:** Pushing through my **Computer Science studies**—I'm always working to connect the theory (like OS/kernel concepts) with my hands-on lab projects.

* **Career:** Actively hunting for an internship 

* **Growth:** Constant, non-stop personal and knowledge growth. If I'm not learning something new, I'm doing it wrong.
